Introduction: This folder contains(ReadMe) all important information for this website.
The Html website structure is stored here to allow fast updates and to track changes being made.
 It is a website built on Html and CSS which is created to provide relevant information to students and 
 external people about the department.This ReadMe contains all informations concerning the building of the website.
  This project(Computer Science website) was made to help students and interested people to navigate and get first 
  hand information from the website without being at the department physically.

How to clone and set up the project: 
Cloning and setting up the project was a major task in the creation of the website. 
We clone a repository from github.com to your local computer to make it easier to fix ,
 merge conflicts and add or reove files and push larger commits. Forking is another term used in github where you 
 fork an original repository to have access to another persons repository and also helps to allow multiple 
 collaborators to contribute in a project.

 Setting up git:
To use Git and GitHub in VS Code, first make sure you have Git installed on your computer. If Git is missing, the Source Control view shows instructions on how to install it. Make sure to restart VS Code afterwards.Additionally you can sign into VS Code with your GitHub account in the Accounts menu in the lower right of the Activity bar to enables additional features like Settings Sync, but also cloning and publishing repositories from GitHub

Clonining a project:
*To clone a repository from GitHub, execute the Git: Clone command or select the Clone Repository button in the Source Control view. If you clone from GitHub, VS Code will prompt you to authenticate with GitHub. This allows you to search all available repositories and clone private repositories. For other Git providers, enter the repository URL and select Clone and pick a folder. VS Code opens the folder once the repository is cloned on your local machine.

*Publish local repository to GitHub
Once you have a local Git repository set up, you can publish it to GitHub. This will create a new repository on your GitHub account, and push your local code to the         remote repository. Having your source code on a remote repository is a great way to back up your code, collaborate with others, and automate your workflow with GitHub       Actions.Use the Publish to GitHub command button in the Source Control view. You can then choose a name and description for the repository, and whether to make it public or private. Once the repository has been created, VS Code will push your local code to the remote repository. Your code is now backed up on GitHub, and you can start collaborating with others with commits and pull requests.

What I learnt in building this website: 
Building this website has really taught me alot, from creativity, to patience and being vigilant. 
I learnt in this process that I can achieve a lot wwith patience and focus. 
I had difficulties in using the git and github for commiting my changes and uploading files but i found a 
solution at the end of the day. Using github was a struggle for me but i had to learn it because it was a way of 
submiting this work. In this project, i learnt about forking a repository, pilling a request and finding solutions
 to problems i came accross in the project.
